## Basic Overview

I am pleased to present my latest project, a web forum front-end built using React. The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly interface for a web forum, where users can easily navigate and participate in discussions. The front-end was built using React and is fully responsive, making it accessible on multiple devices. I also used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the interface. The project is currently hosted on GitHub and is open-source, feel free to check it out, and give any feedback. I am excited about this project and would love to continue developing it in the future.

### Backend of the Project
- **Backend**: https://github.com/vishnu4157/CodeCampus_Server

## Getting Started

### Cloning the repository
Clone the repository.

HTTPS Method:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vishnu4157/CodeCampus_Client.git
```

**NOTE:** please ensure to have cloned the CodeCampus_Server repository as well, before you npm start the client to access the full features.

once Cloned, navigate to the root directory of the project open it in and ensure to:

```shell
npm install
```

follwed by:

```shell
npm start
```

### Lessons Learnt and Future Improvement Ideas

**First Time Dealing with Web Development:**
As this was my first time working with web development, I had to learn React and Ruby on Rails from scratch. I had to self-learn the languages and their fundamentals in just one week, which was a challenging but rewarding experience.

**Self Learn the Language and its Fundamentals in 1 Week:**
I quickly learned that web development is a vast field and it was important for me to learn the basics as fast as possible. I used online tutorials, documentation, and video lectures to learn the basics of React and Ruby on Rails. Despite the steep learning curve, I was able to learn the fundamentals in just one week.

**File Structuring and Functional Components:**
In hindsight, I realize that my file structuring and the use of functional components could have been better. I should have organized the code into different files based on their use cases, such as creating a new folder called "components" or "pages". This would have made the code more readable and easier to navigate.

**Abstraction Concepts:**
I didn't fully make use of various abstraction concepts while developing the web forum. However, I will be taking CS2113 in the upcoming semester and hope to learn more about software development life cycle and fundamentals to use and improve the app further in terms of code efficiency.

**useContext in React:**
I realized that I didn't make full use of the useContext function in React and instead relied on passing children down the nested tree. This made certain instances of logic or code complex and required more lines of code than if I had used useContext. Although I familiarized myself with useContext quite late in the web development process, I did try to make use of it whenever possible. This helped me understand the importance of context management in React and how it can improve the overall structure and maintainability of the code.

**Axios Requests:**
I could have used a base URL instead of always typing "http://localhost:3000/" for my axios requests. This would have made the code more readable and easier to maintain.

**Axios Common Header:**
I should have set up an axios common header with the JWT token so that it goes to the backend with every request and can be authorized before any action is performed. This would have introduced a more robust security system.

**TypeScript:**
I should have used TypeScript, which would have made it easier to deal with errors and improve the overall quality of the code. But I went forward with JavaScript as it felt more native to use when initially learning web development on a steep curve.

**Overall Experience:**
The whole project was undertaken as a first step towards learning about web development on a full stack level. I learned and grew throughout the process, making the experience more important to me than the actual web forum. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole coding experience and I am excited to continue developing my skills and exploring new technologies in the future.
